# Do All The Things
A todo list application we made for our final project in Grove City College's COMP 402A: Android Programming. 

# Features
 - Serialize todo items to local storage and load on next app open
 - Todo items displayed in RecyclerViews that allow swiping to complete items
 - CardViews used inside the RecyclerViews for a material design look
 - Scheduled notifications appear a certain amount of time before the item is due
